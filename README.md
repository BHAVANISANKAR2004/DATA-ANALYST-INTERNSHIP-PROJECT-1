# **Retail Performance Analysis (Project 1) & Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Prediction (Project 2)**

## **Project Overview**

### **Project 1: Retail Performance Analysis**

In this project, we analyze the retail sales performance using a dataset from the “Sample Superstore” to derive insights that can guide business decisions. This analysis uses Python to clean the data, perform visualizations, and generate key insights related to sales, profit, and customer behavior. The goal is to assess the performance of various products across different regions and time periods to understand what drives sales and profitability. The findings can help decision-makers optimize inventory, target marketing efforts more effectively, and adjust pricing strategies. 

The dataset used for the analysis contains order-level information, including sales data, profit data, product details, customer demographics, and geographical information. By analyzing this dataset, we can identify profitable regions, categories, and sub-categories, and also explore factors such as seasonality in sales.

### **Project 2: Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Prediction**

The second project aims to predict the Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) based on customer purchase behavior. LTV is a metric used to estimate the total value a customer will bring to a business over their entire relationship. In this project, we employ a Random Forest Regressor model to predict the monetary value of each customer by considering how recent their last purchase was, how often they make a purchase, and the total value of their purchases. The model is built using transaction data from an e-commerce platform.

Understanding the LTV of customers can help businesses with customer segmentation, targeted marketing campaigns, and retention strategies. By identifying customers with high LTV, businesses can focus their marketing efforts on retaining these valuable customers while exploring ways to increase the LTV of lower-value customers.

## **Tools Used**

Both projects utilize Python as the primary programming language. Specifically, **Pandas** is used for data manipulation and analysis, allowing us to clean the data, perform aggregations, and generate new features. **NumPy** aids in numerical operations, while **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** are used for creating visualizations, helping to better understand the data and highlight trends and patterns. For the machine learning aspect of **Project 2**, we use **Scikit-learn** to build and evaluate the Random Forest model. Both projects are executed in a **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab** environment, which allows for easy documentation of the process and sharing of the results.

## **Steps Involved in Building the Projects**

### **Project 1: Retail Performance Analysis**

The first step in the project is data preprocessing, where we clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. This involves handling missing values, filtering data to focus on specific segments (such as sales within a particular year or region), and performing necessary transformations, like converting date columns to datetime objects.

Once the data is ready, we move on to data analysis, where we explore the dataset to uncover key patterns and relationships. For example, we may identify which product categories generate the most sales or profits, or which regions are underperforming in terms of profitability.

Data visualization plays a critical role in the analysis. We use **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create different types of charts such as bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps. These visualizations help to convey our findings in a more understandable way, allowing us to see trends over time or highlight discrepancies between regions or product categories.

Finally, based on the analysis and visualizations, we generate insights regarding the overall retail performance. These insights may include identifying profitable months, top-performing product categories, or regional differences in sales performance. The final step involves summarizing these findings and offering actionable business strategies to optimize sales and profitability.

### **Project 2: Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Prediction**

For the second project, we begin by loading and cleaning the e-commerce dataset. This includes removing any rows that have missing **CustomerID** values, as they are critical to identifying individual customers. We also handle other missing values and check for any outliers that might skew the analysis. One of the key preprocessing steps is creating a new feature called **TotalPrice**, which is derived by multiplying the quantity of an item by its unit price for each transaction.

Once the data is cleaned, we proceed with feature engineering, where we calculate important features for each customer. These include:
- **Recency**: The number of days since the customer’s last purchase.
- **Frequency**: The total number of purchases made by the customer.
- **Monetary**: The total amount spent by the customer.

After preparing these features, we split the dataset into training and testing sets, with an 80-20 split. This ensures that we can train the model on one portion of the data while evaluating its performance on unseen data.

Next, we build a **Random Forest Regressor** model to predict the **Monetary** value, which is the LTV of the customer. We evaluate the model’s performance using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, both of which give us a sense of how well the model is predicting the actual values.

Additionally, we perform an analysis of feature importance, which helps us understand which features (e.g., recency, frequency, monetary) are most influential in predicting LTV. Finally, we save the predicted LTV values in a CSV file, which can be used for further analysis or marketing purposes.

## **How to Run the Projects**

### **For Retail Performance Analysis (Project 1)**:
To run this project, clone the repository to your local machine or download the files. Then, install the required Python libraries by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once the environment is set up, open the Jupyter notebook `Retail_Performance_Analysis.ipynb` and execute the cells to run the analysis. The notebook will guide you through the steps of cleaning the data, analyzing it, and generating visualizations.

### **For Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Prediction (Project 2)**:
Similarly, for the second project, clone or download the repository and install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
You can run the Python script or open the Jupyter/Google Colab notebook to execute the LTV prediction analysis. The notebook will guide you through the process of cleaning the data, building the model, and evaluating its performance.
