# Retail Performance Analysis ( Project 1 )

# Project Overview - 1
This project analyzes the retail sales performance of a dataset from the "Sample Superstore" using Python, including data cleaning, visualization, and insights generation. The goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of sales, profits, and customer behavior to help improve decision-making in retail business strategies.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the **Sample Superstore** dataset, which contains information about orders, products, customers, and their sales performance.

### Columns in the dataset:
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **Product ID**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **Category**: The category of the product.
- **Sub-Category**: The sub-category of the product.
- **Sales**: The sales amount for the product.
- **Profit**: The profit made from the product.
- **Region**: Geographical region of the sale.
- **Order Date**: Date the order was placed.

Tools Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For creating and running the analysis.
- **GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.

Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values, filtering data, and performing necessary transformations.
2. **Data Analysis**: Analyze the data to identify key patterns and insights regarding sales performance.
3. **Visualization**: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating various visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, etc.
4. **Insights**: Identify which categories, sub-categories, and months are profitable or losing money. 
5. **Conclusion**: Summarize the findings and suggest actionable insights for improving business performance.

Project Files
- **Retail_Performance_Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data analysis and visualization.
- **Retail_Performance_Analysis_Report.pdf**: Final report summarizing the analysis and insights.
- **Sample - Superstore.csv**: Dataset used for the analysis.

Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Prediction - Project 2
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the lifetime value (LTV) of customers using their purchase behavior data. The model is built using the Random Forest Regressor to predict the monetary value of customers based on their recency (how recent their last purchase was) and frequency (how often they make a purchase).

Tools Used
Python (Programming Language)

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis

NumPy: For numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization

Scikit-learn: For machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor) and model evaluation

Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab: For executing the code

CSV File: E-commerce business transaction dataset

Steps Involved in Building the Project
Data Preprocessing:

Loaded the e-commerce dataset containing transaction data.

Cleaned the data by removing rows with missing CustomerID and handling any other missing or incorrect values.

Created a new feature, TotalPrice, by multiplying Quantity with UnitPrice.

Feature Engineering:

Calculated key features for each customer:

Recency: How many days since their last purchase.

Frequency: How often they make a purchase.

Monetary: The total value of their purchases.

Data Splitting:

Split the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split.

Model Building:

Built a Random Forest Regressor model to predict the Monetary value (Customer Lifetime Value).

Evaluated the model's performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Feature Importance:

Visualized the importance of each feature used in the model, particularly Recency and Frequency.

Saving the Results:

The final predicted Customer LTV values were saved in a CSV file for future analysis.

Conclusion
This project successfully predicted the Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) based on the customer's purchase behavior using the Random Forest Regressor. By analyzing the recency, frequency, and total monetary value of transactions, the model provides valuable insights that can be used for targeted marketing and customer segmentation in e-commerce businesses.

How to Run the Code
Clone or download this repository to your local system.

Install the necessary libraries by running:

nginx
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Run the Python script or Jupyter/Google Colab notebook to execute the code.

Future Improvements
Experiment with other machine learning models like XGBoost or Gradient Boosting to improve prediction accuracy.

Include additional features like customer demographics or product categories to enhance the model.

Perform hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.
